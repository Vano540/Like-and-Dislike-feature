        <p id="page2P">Hello everyone, my name is Ivan, I'm a skateboarder.
             I started skating when I was 14 years old in 2004 and I still really enjoy it. 
             I want to share my experience with you, teach you what I can do, and show you how much fun you can get while skateboarding. 
             I speak both English and Russian. I teach skateboarding as for adults, as for children.
            I will be really glad to meet you </p>
